    Example Usage:
    1. To get devices on netbox with Year of investment in 3/2022:
        # First, search for devices with the "Year of investment" field
        devices = get_objects("devices", {"cf_year_of_investment": 3/2022})

        # Returns the list of matching devices
        return devices
    
    2. To get all devices in a site:
        # First, find the site by name
        site = get_objects("sites", {"name": "site-name"})

        # Then, get devices in that site
        devices = get_objects("devices", {"site_id": site[0]["id"]})
        
        # Returns the list of devices in the specified site
        return devices 

    3. To get devices with Year of investment in 3/2022:
        # First, search for devices with the "Year of investment" field
        devices = get_objects("devices", {"cf_year_of_investment": 3/2022})

        return devices

    4. To get list devices on netbox:
        devices = get_objects("devices", {})
        return devices

    5. To get a specific device:
        get_object_by_id("devices", 123)

    6. To create a new device:
        create_object("devices", {

        devices = get_objects("devices", {"name": "router1"})
        
        # If multiple devices are found, you can use the first one

    Remember to:
    - Always validate object types before making requests

    Use the `get_count_objects` tool to count objects in NetBox based on their type and filters.
    
    Example:
    To count devices with a specific custom field:
    count = get_count_objects("devices", {"cf_year_of_investment": "3/2022"})
    return Netbox has {count} devices with Year of investment in 3/2022.

    To how many devices are in NetBox:

    - ip-addresses
    - vlans
    - prefixes
    - sites
    - racks
    - etc.
